# plugin.video.wco WatchCartoonOnline plugin for Kodi
Kodi plugin for http://watchcartoononline.io/

**Tested on Kodi Krypton 17.0+**

I'm only doing this for educational purposes (learning addon development for Kodi) and hold no responsibility

# Instructions

In Kodi Add Addon from zip file -> Direct to downloaded path.

This is a basic release.
Ideas are welcome.

# Plans:
Add download feature to support external web based download managers like aria2.
